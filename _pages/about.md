I am a Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science, at Case Western Reserve University. My research interests include Gen AI, Multimodality, Time-Series Data, and AI for Science.
        
I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jing Li of AI Center for Health and Pandemic Preparedness from the School of Engineering and co-supervised by Prof. Xiao Li from the School of Medicine, at Case Western Reserve University.
